# Planning
## System Structure
(can determine if we need this much depth once we determine the assignment)
## User Stories

## UML class diagram

## database structuring 
(can implement MySQL with a JDBC[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/establishing-jdbc-connection-in-java/] note: will have to reference this if we use its code)

## Project Requirements
(what tasks need to be completed by the end of the project)
---
# Testing

## UI/UX navigation 
(show different screens and explain whats happening)
Demo video inserted here
## Backend Logical tests
(if backend can be unit tested to confirm logic put here)
